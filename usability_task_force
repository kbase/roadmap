# Usability Task Force
Although there is a concerted effort from the UE team to solicit feedback on the existing features of the KBase platform,
there is no central resource to coordinate, for developers, usability tests of prototypes or mockups of proposed new
user-facing features. The result is that most developers do not do any usability testing until after most of the design
and coding work is done, at which point it is much more expensive to make significant changes. This proposal will create
an ongoing "Usability Task Force" that will maintain a set of resources for all project developers on how and when
to do usability testing, and will also collect and help present the knowledge gained from these tests. The UTF would
help conduct tests, record and archive results, and standardize some of the outputs for easy consumption by the rest
of the project.
