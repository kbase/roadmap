## Improved Dashboard

### Summary
Our current Dashboard was designed over a year ago provides a limited amount of information. It primarily acts as an aggregator of Narratives accessible by the user with a fixed splitting based on ownership and sharing of the Narrative. Additionally, it provides some statistics on methods and sharing. Since the initial creation of the Dashboard, significant new features have been added to KBase and we have a better understanding of the needs of our users. This project proposes to update our Dashboard. 

### Story/Description
The goal of the Dashboard is to organize and present information to the returning user so they can quickly see relevant, important information and status updates and then get started quickly on their analysis. 

In order to do this, we need to assess the information and status updates that are available: running jobs; new shares; recently updated shared items; popularity (views) of shared/public narratives; updates to existing methods; new methods relevant to the user; etc. The Dashboard should also support our Developer users by highlighting usage and issues with the methods they've contributed. 

Additionally, we need to re-evaluate the narrative specific information that is displayed to the user. Currently, the Narrative documents show the name, an alphabetical list of the apps they contain, an icon to flag running jobs, and a timestamp. A summary description (or abstract) should be added to each Narrative and displayed. And some indication of the data contained in the Narrative should also be available.

#### Approach
We will inventory the information available to be displayed, create mock designs, evaluate designs with user groups and then implement our new design.

### User Stories


### Narrative Mockup
Mockups will be made as part of the sprint.

### Timeline
1. Sprint 1: Assess available information streams, create mockups, evaluate mockups with user groups.
2. Sprint 2: Implement design, test and document.

### Test Plan
We will first do user testing of our prototype mockups and initial implementation. This will be done by asking them to complete a series of tasks and evaluating the effectiveness of the design and by allowing the users to play with the new Dashboard and provide feedback. We use the existing practices for unit and integration testing.
