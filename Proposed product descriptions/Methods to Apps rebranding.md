## Rebranding Methods to Apps

### Summary
This proposal is to rebrand what is currently referred to as a Narrative Method to an App.

### Description
The proposed work is to complete the process of changing the name of our current methods to apps. This needs to be done by making minor changes to the Narrative UI, and identifying the locations in our documentation where methods are mentioned and changing them to Apps. We will also need to post messages to our users to inform them of the change.

### Timeline
This can be completed with in one sprint using less than a full sprint team.
