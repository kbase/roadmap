# Sequence Types

This effort would involve the creation of new types for any sequence data not currently captured in our system, and standardization of existing sequence types for Reads, Assembly, etc and Data API for Sequence types. This relies on the Blob Data API work existing.  Without Blob Data API, we would have to deal with storing sequence data via Blobs here and then again for any new types in the future that depend on Blob data.  At the end of Q3 for sequence types we would have improved upload, Landing Pages, Narrative viewers, data manipulation, etc.
