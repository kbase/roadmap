## Summary
The present version of RNA-seq service is essentially an implementation of the RNA-seq Tuxedo protocol for prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Currently, it provides an integrated computational workflow for RNA-seq based gene expression analysis for microbes and flagship plant genomes. This service aligns the RNA-seq reads, assigns aligned reads to genes and performs differential gene expression analysis to detect differential transcript abundances between tissues, developmental stages, genetic backgrounds, and environmental conditions. 

We plan to extend this pipeline with a next generation of RNA-seq tools which are emerging as faster and more accurate alternatives, whether itâ€™s the detection and quantification of reads or the assembled transcripts or the differentially expressed genes. 

## Use cases:
1. As a user, I want to use FastQC to study the read sequence quality and Trimmomatic (already available in KBase) to filter out the low quality regions from the sequences.

2. As a user, I want to use Star/HiSat2 to conduct sample read alignments against a reference genome.

3. As a user, I want to use DESeq/Ballgown to conduct differential gene expression analysis based on the transcripts assembled from the sequenced reads using EdgePro/StringTie.

## Candidates for 2016 Q3:
1. Reads Import: Reads QC, trimming, error correction, pre-processing, QC visualization and generates report (Add FastQC and enable Trimmomatic existing in KBase)

2. Reads alignment: mapping of individual samples to a reference genome/transcriptome - counting the number of mapped reads, quality control of the aligned reads. It will need parallel processing of reads and better tools for visualization of Bam files (STAR/HISAT2)
 
3. Transcriptome assembly: EdgePro/StringTie to assemble transcripts. Currently Cufflinks is used.
 
4. Fast, flexible differential expression analysis: DESeq/Ballgown can be used to visualize the transcript assembly on a gene by gene basis; abundance estimates for exons, introns, transcripts; perform linear model based diff analyses.

5. Visualization:
 1. Visualization for read coverage profiles, summary stats. This is pretty generic to all alignment outputs, although RNA-seq coverage will be sparse. Internally this can use bedtools genomeCoverageBed or samtools mpileup. Note: JBrowse to view bam alignments has also been discussed in other PDs.
 2. Data transformation and query services with BEDTools:
  1. Support for Alignments from bam to bed format and make it downloadable (bedtools bamtobed)
  2. Support for targeted use cases to query using bedtools with reference annotation (bedtools intersect)
  3. Coverage across certain genes (bedtools coverage)
  4. Overlap/proximity of genes with other genomic features (bedtools overlap)
