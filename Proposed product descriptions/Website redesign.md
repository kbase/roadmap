## Title
kbase.us home page redesign

### Summary 
The kbase.us informational website is one of the key ways that potential users discover KBase and decide whether to try it. The kbase.us homepage needs to accurately and succinctly convey what KBase has to offer, and make it easy for users to find the information they are looking for. Feedback from user testing has indicated that new users find it hard to ascertain from the home page what KBase does and why they might want to use it.

### Story/Description  
With help from a professional web designer, we plan to redesign the content and layout of the kbase.us home page, as well as the website navigation, in order to achieve the following objectives:
1) Better communicate what KBase is and its advantages compared to other systems
2) Make it clearer to the target user base (bench biologists) what they can do in KBase
3) Highlight successes with the system
4) Improve new user onboarding process

In order to ensure that the redesign achieves these objectives, we will test the new homepage on a staging server, asking some naive users questions such as:
* Looking at the home page, can you summarize what KBase is?
* From reading the homepage, do you think that KBase could be useful for your research?
* What would you click on first?

We will also monitor and analyze the Google Analytics website statistics and the usage metrics for new and returning users and look for increased stickiness.

The website was extensively redesigned about a year and a half ago, but it is time to update it to reflect the latest state of the project (including the SDK) as well as recent style trends in website design. For example, the slide carousel on the homepage was a popular design feature two years ago, but at this point, it has mostly been supplanted by long scrolling home pages.

We will process and analyze feedback about the website that we have already collected from new and potential users (see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cawX5xMmaeC2ANIv6IJZGEepO5pNyw9up6JYgRKRkTs/edit). We will also identify and interview other potential new users who represent the types of people we are targeting (i.e., mostly bench biologists, with a particular focus on sequencing centers). Once we decide what information (text and images) should be included on the homepage, we will solicit design proposals from at least one, or possibly several, professional web designers.

We will show mockups of the proposed designs to naive users and get their feedback, iterating back with the designers to adjust the design as needed, before implementing the new design on the live site. We will also continue to seek and consider feedback on the website once the new design has been implemented.

Please note: although we have also collected feedback on how narrative.kbase.us (including the user dashboard as well as the Narrative Interface) could be improved, that is outside the scope of this campaign. However, in this redesign, we will strive for a more unified user experience between the two sites--for example, being sure that terms (such as "app") are used consistently, sharing colors and symbols when possible, etc.

### User stories
(Note: the main audience for kbase.us is bench biologists who we want to attract and quickly get engaged.)

* Susan the systems biologist visits the kbase.us home page to determine whether KBase will be useful to her. She wants a quick summary of tools and data in KBase.
* Mateo the microbiologist hits a kbase.us page while doing a web search for the bacterial genus Shewanella. She is interested in finding out what data and analysis tools KBase has that are relevant to her Shewanella research.
* Beverly Bioinformaticist works on assembly tools. She investigates which assembly tools KBase has, and wonders whether she could integrate her assembly tool into KBase by using the SDK.
* Bioinformatics graduate student Carlos prefers learning about resources from live training events rather than by reading documentation. He looks at kbase.us to find out when the next KBase workshop will be, and discovers that we have training videos and webinars.
* Power user Paula wants detailed information about gapfilling algorithms in KBase. She searches kbase.us for documentation.
* Metabolic modeling expert Abdullah wants to know how media data is structured in KBase. He finds the answer in the Metabolic Modeling FAQ.  
* Sarah Scientist wants to know how other scientists have used KBase to advance their research.
* New user Nate wants to try KBase but isn't sure where to start. He looks at the home page and the menus to quickly figure out how to register and start using the system. If he finds the process too onerous, he will give up.

### Narrative Mockup
N/A

### Test plan
We will develop a standardized list of questions to ask users when testing the new website (either via mockups or a live staging site), including:
* Looking at the kbase.us home page, can you summarize what KBase is?
* From reading the homepage, do you think that KBase could be useful for your research?
* What would you click on first?
* What do you like/not like about the website design and navigation?
* Can you find documentation about [some topic of interest to the specific tester]? 

### Timeline
The redesign will be tested on a staging server by the end of 2016 Q3 and publicly deployed soon after.
Steps:
* Review and analyze the feedback weâ€™ve already collected about kbase.us, and identify actionable points.
* Interview a few new users (e.g., at the ASM booth), show them the current kbase.us home page, and ask them a few targeted questions (see list in Test Plan)
* Decide on the text and images we want to feature on the home page, and on how we want to simplify/improve site navigation
* Get design proposals from professional web designer(s)
* Show the proposed designs to several users and potential users and get their feedback
* Implement new design on staging site
* Test new design on naive users, and improve design iteratively based on feedback
* Roll out new design to production site
