## Title
kbase.us website redesign

### Summary 
The kbase.us informational website is an important way to reach potential and active users. This proposal is to update the website based on feedback from potential/new users.

### Story/Description  
The kbase.us website is one of the key ways that potential users discover KBase and decide whether to try it. We want the homepage to accurately and succinctly convey what KBase has to offer, and make it easy for users to find the information they are looking for. The website was extensively redesigned about a year and a half ago, but it is time to update it to reflect the latest state of the project (including the SDK) as well as recent style trends in website design. For example, the slide carousel on the homepage was a popular design feature two years ago, but at this point, it has mostly been supplanted by long scrolling home pages.

Our goal in this sprint is to redesign the content and layout of the kbase.us home page,the style of internal pages, and the navigation based on user feedback and design suggestions from professional web designers. We will process and analyze feedback about the website that we have already collected from new and potential users (see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cawX5xMmaeC2ANIv6IJZGEepO5pNyw9up6JYgRKRkTs/edit). We will also identify and interview other potential new users who represent the types of people we are targeting (i.e., mostly bench biologists, with a particular focus on sequencing centers). Once we decide what information (text and images) should be included on the homepage, we will solicit design proposals from at least one, or possibly several, professional web designers. There are web designers available on a contract basis at LBNL and we will also consider freelance web designers who are not directly affiliated with those organizations.

We will show mockups of the proposed designs to naive users and get their feedback, iterating back with the designers to adjust the design as needed, before implementing the new design on the live site. We will also continue to seek and consider feedback on the website once the new design has been implemented.

Please note: although we have also collected feedback on how narrative.kbase.us (including the user dashboard as well as the Narrative Interface) could be improved, that is outside the scope of this campaign. However, in this redesign, we will strive for a unified user experience between the two sites--for example, being sure that terms (such as "apps") are used consistently, sharing colors and symbols when possible, etc.

### User stories
(Note: the main audience for kbase.us is bench biologists who we want to attract and quickly get engaged.)

* Susan the systems biologist visits the kbase.us home page to determine whether KBase will be useful to her. She wants a quick summary of tools and data in KBase.
* Mateo the microbiologist hits a kbase.us page while doing a web search for the bacterial genus Shewanella. She is interested in finding out what data and analysis tools KBase has that are relevant to her Shewanella research.
* Beverly Bioinformaticist works on assembly tools. She investigates which assembly tools KBase has, and wonders whether she could integrate her assembly tool into KBase by using the SDK.
* Bioinformatics graduate student Carlos prefers learning about resources from live training events rather than by reading documentation. He looks at kbase.us to find out when the next KBase workshop will be, and discovers that we have training videos and webinars.
* Power user Paula wants detailed information about gapfilling algorithms in KBase. She searches kbase.us for documentation.
* Metabolic modeling expert Abdullah wants to know how media data is structured in KBase. He finds the answer in the Metabolic Modeling FAQ.  
* DOE Program Manager Ramana wants to know which other projects are leveraging KBase.

### Narrative Mockup
N/A

### Test plan
We will develop a standardized list of questions to ask users when testing the new website (either via mockups or a live staging site), including:
* Looking at the kbase.us home page, can you summarize what KBase is?
* From reading the homepage, do you think that KBase could be useful for your research?
* What do you like/not like about the website design and navigation?
* Can you find documentation about [some topic of interest to the specific tester]? 

### Timeline
The redesign will be complete and deployed by the end of 2016 Q3.
Steps:
* Review and analyze the feedback weâ€™ve already collected about kbase.us, and identify actionable points.
* Interview a few new users (e.g., at the ASM booth), show them the current kbase.us home page, and ask them a few targeted questions (see list in Test Plan)
* Decide on the text and images we want to feature on the home page, and on how we want to simplify/improve site navigation
* Get design proposals (at least 2) from professional web designers
* Show the proposed designs to several users and potential users and get their feedback
* Implement new design on staging site
* Roll out new design to production site
