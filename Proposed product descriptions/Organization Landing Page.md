## Organization Landing Page

### Summary
This product is the creation of a landing page for organizations - these are groups of users that share credit for group contributions to KBase.

### Story/Description
In order to attract third party contributions, both data and tools, we need prominent branding of organizations so that data and tool contributions can be properly credited to an institution.  This is part of the larger problem of enabling groups in KBase, but much more specific, and may not necessarily imply sharing privileges.

A User should be able to create an Organization, serve as an Organization admin, and allow users to be associated to the organization.  A landing page for each group should be available that allows a logo, description, links to be attached.  Tools and public workspaces can then be attached to the organization.  The organization page should display these contributions with usage statistics and organization team members.  Tools and workspaces in KBase should also be branded and linked to the organization page appropriately.
