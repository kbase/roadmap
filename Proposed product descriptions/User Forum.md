# Product Description for User Forum

### Summary 
A KBase User Forum will enable users to answer each others’ questions and search previous questions and answers, thereby providing a (potentially) faster way for them to get answers while decreasing the internal support burden.

### Description
Currently, the main ways for users to get answers to their questions are to search the documentation on kbase.us or to contact us via the Help Desk. Although the questions and answers that go through the Help Desk are sometimes archived on kbase.us (mostly in the FAQs), there’s no easy way for users to search for answers to questions that other users have already asked, nor is there a way for users to help each other.  (Note that both of these limitations would be ameliorated if we had an open JIRA.)

We propose to launch a User Forum to allow external users to interact freely with KBase developers and scientists, as well as with each other, in order to get answers to their questions and ideas for things to do in KBase. Our first step will be to investigate forum software (ideally, it would integrate with our Wordpress site) and set up the forum for internal testing. We will also pre-seed the forum with some questions and answers.

On an ongoing basis, the UE team will monitor the forum to prevent spam (as well as checking that user questions are answered in a reasonable amount of time).

### Dependencies and risks
When the forum is rolled out publicly (in Q4), initially most of the questions would have to be answered by KBase staff, which is a concern. User questions that are submitted via the Help Desk don’t always get quick responses even though they are assigned to the appropriate staff member; the User Forum would rely on KBase staff volunteering to answer questions that are not explicitly assigned to them. In order to make the forum successful, internal staff would have to allocate time to check the forum frequently and answer questions that fall into their area of expertise. We will have to devise some system to encourage KBase staff to do this, since it will be something that most people will simply passively avoid.

### User stories
* User Carmela is having trouble with the Narrative Interface on her Opera browser. She wants advice from others who use Opera.
* Prospective user Peter wants to know if anyone has used KBase for synthetic approaches to biofuel design.
* Bioinformatics developer Devin is trying to wrap his promoter prediction tool using the SDK, but has some questions.
* Scientist Saara wonders if anyone has a custom media for growing Shewanella that doesn’t contain phosphorus, and if so, can they share their media file?
* User Ursula asks whether anyone has a code cell that will translate between fig IDs and KBase IDs.
* Biologist Bharati is interested in constructing a phenotype set for biolog data, and is looking for examples. 
* Scientist Steve read a paper about a new assembler and wonders whether anyone is integrating it into KBase.

### Timeline
* For the first sprint in Q3, we will investigate platforms for hosting the forum.
* Next, we will test the forum internally.
* Next, we will find some external volunteers to test it.
* We will pre-seed the forum with some questions and answers.
* We will work with the whole KBase team to develop a plan/schedule for who’s going to answer user questions on the forum.
