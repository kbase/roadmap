# Pull to KBase

## Summary
This will improve our integration with sequencing centers. 

## Story/Description

We need to define a clear path for new users to get their data into the system and begin using KBase methods.  This will help by adding new methods of getting data into the system by pulling from ftp and http/s sites, as well as adding to our knowledgebase a set of processes new users can follow to bring their data into KBase.  Initially we will target 2-3 sequencing centers which we believe are utilized by target users.  

## User stories
User 1 would like to import data from LBL QB3.
User 2 would like to import data from UChicago Sequencing core.  
User 3 would like to know what seqencing centers KBase interoperates with, and how to contact those centers to submit an experiment.

## Timeline
#### Sprint 1 
1. Evaluate options for PulltKB.  Begin implementation plan.

#### Sprint 2
1. Implement authenticated ftp and http into the bulk UI
2. First cut implementation/modification of backend methods

#### Sprint 3 
1. User testing
2. Complete developer documentation


## Test plan
1. Test each user story after the sprint that implements the functionality
2. We will test iternally during S1 and S2, during S3 we will engage 3rd party testers through UE.
